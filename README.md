# Personal Portfolio Tracker

A self-hosted, single-user net worth and investment portfolio tracker. No cloud, no subscriptions, no data leaving your machine.

Built with Express + SQLite on the backend and React + Vite on the frontend.

## Features

### Dashboard
- Net worth card (assets − liabilities)
- **XIRR returns** — 1-year, 3-year, and all-time, each paired with the MSCI World benchmark return for the same period
- **Net worth over time** — stacked area chart by asset type (monthly)
- **Asset allocation** — two donut charts: actual vs target allocation
- **Contributions vs growth** — stacked bar chart per calendar year

### Assets
- Track stocks, ETFs, savings accounts, real estate, pension, crypto, and other assets
- Per-asset current value using the right method per type:
  - Liquid (stock/ETF/crypto): latest price × net holdings
  - Savings: sum of deposits + interest − withdrawals − fees
  - Illiquid (real estate/pension/other): latest snapshot value
- Manual override via value snapshots (takes precedence over price-based calculation)
- Soft delete (archive) to keep history intact
- XIRR (1Y) and XIRR (all-time) columns in the assets table

### Transactions
- Full transaction history per asset
- Types: buy, sell, deposit, withdrawal, dividend, interest, fee
- Auto-calculates total amount for buy/sell (qty × price ± fee)
- `fee` type: broker/custody costs deducted from savings balance, treated as outflow in XIRR (not a return of capital)

### Prices
- Manual price entry per asset
- **Automatic price fetching** from three sources:
  - **Alpha Vantage** — stocks and ETFs via their Global Quote API
  - **Meesman** — NAV scraped from the Meesman website (4 funds supported)
  - **Brand New Day** — NAV via the BND fund rates API
- "Refresh All Prices" button (bulk, sequential to respect rate limits)
- "Fetch Latest Price" button per asset in the Prices tab
- "Test" button in the asset edit modal to verify a price source before saving

### Yearly Summary (`/yearly`)
- Per-calendar-year table: start NW, contributions, growth, end NW, nominal XIRR %, real return %, MSCI World %
- All-time row at the bottom
- Expandable per-asset breakdown with subtotals per asset type

### Liabilities
- Track mortgages, loans, and other liabilities
- Balance snapshots with optional interest rate

### CSV Import (`/import`)
- Multi-step flow: upload → (account mapping for ABN Savings) → row review → commit
- Duplicate detection before saving
- Supported formats:
  - **ABN AMRO brokerage** (CSV) — buy, sell, dividend, CA (dividend reinvestment)
  - **ABN AMRO savings account** (TAB) — buy, sell, dividend, deposit, withdrawal, fee, interest; auto-detected by `.TAB` extension; requires fund→asset mapping on first import
  - **Centraal Beheer** (CSV, UTF-16 LE encoded) — buy transactions only; `Overboeking` rows skipped
  - **Meesman** (CSV) — buy transactions; `Dividend herbelegging` emits a synthetic dividend + buy pair so the reinvestment has zero net XIRR impact

### Benchmark & CPI data entry
- Manual entry of MSCI World index prices for benchmark comparison
- Manual entry of CPI data for real return calculation

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Server | Node.js, Express 4 |
| Database | SQLite via `better-sqlite3` |
| HTML scraping | Cheerio |
| CSV parsing | PapaParse + Multer |
| Client | React 18, React Router 6 |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Build | Vite 5 |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (global `fetch` is used server-side)
- npm

### Install

```bash
# Server
cd server
npm install

# Client
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Run in development

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API server on :3001
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Vite dev server on :5174 (proxies /api to :3001)
cd client
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174).

### Build for production (without Docker)

```bash
cd client
npm run build
cp -r dist/* ../server/public/
```

Then `node server/index.js` — Express serves both the API and the React app.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` | Optional | Enables Alpha Vantage price fetching. Free tier: 25 requests/day. |
| `DB_PATH` | Optional | SQLite file path (default: `/data/wealth.db` in Docker, `../../data/wealth.db` otherwise). |
| `PORT` | Optional | HTTP port (default: 3001). |

Price fetching is always **user-initiated** — no background polling — to stay within the free tier limit.

## Docker / NAS Deployment

The app ships as a single container. The React client is compiled during the image build and served by the Express server — no separate web server needed.

### Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY if you have one

docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://your-nas-ip:3001](http://your-nas-ip:3001).

The SQLite database is stored in a named Docker volume (`portfolio-data`) so it survives container restarts and upgrades.

### NAS setup (Synology / QNAP / similar)

1. **Copy files to your NAS.** Either `git clone` directly on the NAS or copy just the three files you need:
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `docker-compose.yml`
   - `.env.example` → rename to `.env`

   > If your NAS can't run `git clone`, you can also `docker build` on your Mac and push the image to a registry (Docker Hub, GHCR) and pull it on the NAS — see *Pre-built image* below.

2. **Edit `.env`** on the NAS and set `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` if desired.

3. **Start the container:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Verify it's running:**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f
   # Should print: Portfolio server running on port 3001
   ```

### Updating to a new version

```bash
sudo git pull              # get the latest code
sudo docker compose build  # rebuild the image
sudo docker compose up -d  # restart with the new image
```

The database volume is untouched during updates.

### Backing up the database

```bash
# Find the volume mount path
docker volume inspect portfolio_portfolio-data

# Or copy the db file out directly
docker compose cp portfolio:/data/wealth.db ./wealth-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

### Pre-built image (optional)

If you'd rather not build on the NAS, build and push from your Mac:

```bash
# Replace with your Docker Hub username
docker build -t yourname/portfolio:latest .
docker push yourname/portfolio:latest
```

Then on the NAS, change `docker-compose.yml` to use `image:` instead of `build:`:

```yaml
services:
  portfolio:
    image: yourname/portfolio:latest   # ← replace build: . with this
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - portfolio-data:/data
    environment:
      - ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=${ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY:-}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Expose on a custom port

Change the left side of the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:3001"   # access at :8080 instead of :3001
```

### Run behind a reverse proxy (nginx / Traefik)

The app has no concept of a URL prefix — just proxy the root path to port 3001. Example nginx snippet:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}
```

## XIRR Computation

XIRR is computed in plain JavaScript (no external library) using Newton-Raphson with a bisection fallback. Cash flow sign convention: **buy/deposit/fee = negative (outflow), sell/withdrawal/dividend/interest = positive (inflow)**.

For period-based XIRR (1Y, 3Y):
- A synthetic opening cash flow is added on the period start date equal to the reconstructed asset/portfolio value at that date
- A synthetic terminal inflow is added at today's date equal to the current value

All-time XIRR uses actual transactions only (no synthetic opening) plus a terminal inflow at today.

---

## Still To Do

### Historical price backfill

The current price fetchers only retrieve today's latest NAV. There is no way to backfill historical prices for Meesman — they offer an Excel download of historical NAV data; parsing this is not yet implemented.

### Automatic Dutch CPI fetching (CBS API)

CPI data is currently entered manually in the Data Entry screen. The Dutch national statistics bureau (CBS) publishes CPI data through an open OData API — no key required:

```
https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/odata/83131NED/UntypedDataSet
```

A sync route (`POST /api/cpi/sync`) should fetch the latest monthly CPI figures and upsert them into `cpi_data`. The relevant series is the general consumer price index (`CPI Alle huishoudens`) at monthly frequency. A button in the Data Entry screen should trigger this, replacing the need to look up and enter values manually.

### Automatic MSCI World index price fetching

Benchmark prices are also entered manually. Possible free data sources to explore:

- **Yahoo Finance** — `https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/URTH` (ETF tracking MSCI World, daily OHLC, no key required but undocumented)
- **stooq.com** — CSV download endpoint, no key required
- **Alpha Vantage** — already integrated; the `IWDA.LON` or `URTH` ticker could serve as a proxy

A sync route (`POST /api/benchmark/sync`) with a button in the Data Entry screen would keep the benchmark series up to date automatically, similar to the CPI sync above.

### Per-asset real return in yearly summary

The per-asset rows in the yearly summary always show `—` for real return %. Only the portfolio-level rows compute a real return (nominal XIRR minus annualized CPI). Per-asset real return is straightforward to add once the portfolio-level approach is validated.

## Design Decisions

- **No auth** — single-user, intended to run locally or on a private server
- **No ORM** — raw `better-sqlite3` prepared statements throughout
- **No global state** — React component-local state only (`useState`/`useEffect`)
- **Amounts always positive** in the database; sign is derived from transaction type at computation time
- **`fee` type** — treated as outflow in XIRR and subtracted from savings balance, but excluded from contributions tracking (it's a cost, not a capital movement)
- **Archived assets** are soft-deleted and excluded from current net worth but included in historical XIRR cash flows
- **Snapshot override rule**: a manual value snapshot takes precedence over price-based calculation if it is more recent than the latest price entry
